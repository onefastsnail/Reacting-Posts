This is an example to show a basic React app using the Flux artitecture, and using React clases, as opposed to the magic found using `React.createClass` class. So more normal JS less React magic :).

## Usage

1. `npm install`
2. `gulp`
3. If you need to run a local web server run `./node_modules/.bin/http-server`
