# A React Redux Filter with Routing

Work in progress. Just a prototype / base for wee projects :) using React, Redux, and React Router, bundled with love via Webpack.

I have also created another branch that adds [Redux Form](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form) on this [branch](https://github.com/onefastsnail/Reacting-Posts/tree/redux-form) if your interested.

##Â Usage

1. Install your node modules `npm install`
2. If you need a local server `npm run start` which also boots up Webpack
3. Else to watch the files and to begining developing run `webpack -d --watch`
4. Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)

## How it works

* I will get to this soon :P.

## Notes
* Using Webpack for speedy development
* Using a sample JSON from a Codepen integration i was working on
